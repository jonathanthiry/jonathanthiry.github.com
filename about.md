I'm Jonathan Thiry, a web developer/designer focussed on user experience. I use a mix of tools (Sublime Text, Photoshop), techniques (Responsive Web Design, Mobile First), technologies (JavaScript, node.js) and green tea to create web applications.

I use this website to share my thoughts on technology, design, user experience and more.
