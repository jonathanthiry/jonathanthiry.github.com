I'm a web developer based in London. I create web applications in Sublime Text using techniques such as Responsive Web Design, Mobile First and other JS tricks. I keep everything coherent with green tea.

Sometimes I am torn between form and function, features and UI. Good user experience should try to get the most out of both but compromises are always necessary.

I use this website to share my experience, thoughts and experiments on the intersection between life and technology.
