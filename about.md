I'm Jonathan Thiry, a web developer/designer focussed on user experience. I use a mix of tools (Sublime Text, Photoshop), techniques (Responsive Web Design, Mobile First), technologies (JavaScript, node.js) and green tea to create web applications.

I use this website to [share my thoughts](/blog) on technology, design, user experience and more.

## Colophon

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted by [Linode](http://www.linode.com/).  
The templates and CSS ([LESS](http://lesscss.org/)) are regularly updated in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and everything is uploaded with [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/).  
The typeface is Chaparral and is served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/). The text is then written in [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/).
