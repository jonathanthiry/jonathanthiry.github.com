    <h2>A Wikipedia reader</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="wonder-description">
    <p>I’m on Wikipedia all the time. While the quality of the content can vary, it gives me at least an overview of the topic I’m interested in, and often more. It’s a good research tool. So when I look for an article, I want to find the right one as fast as possible, identify its relevant parts and browse back and forth between articles.</p>
    <p>An app called Articles used to fulfil this role nicely on iOS. Its navigation was inspired by Safari with a search bar at the top of the screen, a navigation bar at the bottom and tabs to navigate between articles. Unfortunately, the app hasn’t been updated in years. I never found a good replacement so after a long wait I decided to create one.</p>
    <p>Wonder is a Wikipedia reader for iOS 9 focussed on search, readability and navigation. It doesn&#8217;t try to guess what you could want to read, but if you have an idea of what to look for, Wonder is a fast and powerful way to research and learn with Wikipedia.</p>
