title: The Omnivore's Dilemma
author: Michael Pollan
---

The book was published 10 years ago and most of its ideas have spread since then. Yet it is a good reminder of how the food industry works and what solutions could lead to a better system. Michael Pollan tells nice stories and the book is a great read in general.
