The microbes in our gut are the key to good health and it's time to take better care of them. Antibiotics, pesticides, C-sections, reduced breast-feeding, extreme sanitisation and pasteurisation are exemples of modern practices that hurt our microbiota and the book goes into details on how to reduce their impact. Fermented foods, dirt, dietary fiber feed the good bacteria.
