Bloggers can be successful by posting once in a while, a few times a week or even every day. I chose a daily routine to help me get into the habit of writing but it is not necessarily the key to good content.

I haven't had much time to write today so it felt forced at first. But once I got in the flow I enjoyed the process. I'm looking for ways to improve my workflow to make it feel more natural. The weekend will give me the opportunity to list topics I want to write about and maybe prepare posts in advance. A bit of planning should make everything easier.

It usually takes about [30 days to create a new habit](http://zenhabits.net/the-habit-change-cheatsheet-29-ways-to-successfully-ingrain-a-behavior/). After that period I should know if the quality is satisfying or if I need to adjust my schedule.
