Title: Rest

The busyness of the working day doesn't leave much time to rest the body and mind. I use different strategies throughout the day   to keep a balance between work and rest.

A quiet morning including body exercise and a juicy omelette is usually a good start. During the day I use [Due](http://www.dueapp.com/mac.html) on my mac to remind me to get up, walk to the kitchen and stretch while preparing a cup of tea. The need for a reminder might sound ridiculous but once I get in the flow of my work it is difficult to remember to get my eyes off the screen regularly. I often work with music to better concentrate and relax. The day can end by cooking a nice meal and a good night sleep.

Thinking about ways to improve this routine, meditation could be a bigger part of my day and [this week's thread on HN about it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5432713) is inspiring me to look further in that direction.
