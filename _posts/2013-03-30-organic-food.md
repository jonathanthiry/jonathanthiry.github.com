Like most Saturday mornings, I went to my local farmers' market. It was especially quiet today, most of the crowd probably left the city for the Easter weekend. I talked to the butcher about the organic label recently disappearing from his packaging. He hasn't suddenly realised it would be more profitable to stuff his cows with drugs. He hasn't even changed any of his methods. He simply cannot justify anymore the cost of the certification. While I'm all for organic methods, it's a shame the government is discouraging small farms to get certified by setting high fees. At the end of the day, I'm happy with his move. He should keep my money instead of spending it on an unfair fee. Labeled or not, I'll keep buying his delicious beef and support my local farmers.
