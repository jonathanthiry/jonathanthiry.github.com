This weekend I refreshed the design of the website. Even if I still like it, I also like to refine it. During the past year, every time I have been looking at the site, I have been thinking about ways to improve it. When I launched this design I wanted a simple layout to be able to focus on the content. I still got distracted along the way.

We need to take care of our tools but we should not forget to do the work. The number of posts on the website proves that I have forgotten. It won't be easy and it won't be good, but today I'm writing again.
