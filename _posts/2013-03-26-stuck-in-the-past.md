Creatives can get stuck because they don't think they will be able to produce something as good as they did previously. I had the opposite problem. I realised how bad my old writing was. The more I waited, the more flaws I saw. I was stuck, ashamed by this mediocrity and scared to produce more of it.

Of course it was a mistake to stop moving. If I publish regularly, my writing will evolve alongside my thoughts. I get more chances to express my ideas but it was not easy to accept it.

Every day is a new opportunity. Whatever we think of previous creations, today we should put the past aside and try our best.
