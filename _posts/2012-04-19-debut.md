I finally took the time to redesign the website, remove the old portfolio, clean up the content and set up this blog. Iâ€™ll be writing about technology, user experience, design, my projects, my thoughts on news and more.

You should start with the [about page](/about) to find out more about me and this website.

You can grab [the rss feed](/feed) to stay updated.
