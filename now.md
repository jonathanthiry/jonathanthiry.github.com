# What I'm doing now

- I am working at Lund's University on the [Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science project](http://www.fieldsites.se/en-GB) and the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/) since September 2017 where I'm helping researchers to store and distribute data on the environment.
- Samantha and I bought a house in the Swedish countryside last August, I enjoy spending a lot of time there, and there is always a lot to do there
- Reading 1984, Health and Light and Ett j√§vla Solsken
- Working out -- my daily training is based on natural movement, both at home and at the gym
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- With the spring coming, I'm planning be in the garden more often and to practice the principles of permaculture
- Playing with Rust and PostgreSQL
- Working on the next version of [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) -- 1.4 added a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview -- Progress has been extremely slow since I got a full time job and a house
