I am working at Lund's University on the [Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science project](http://www.fieldsites.se/en-GB) and the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/) since the beginning of September.
At the same time, Samantha and I are looking for a house around Lund. I spend the rest of my time on:

- Working on the next version of [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) -- 1.4 added a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview -- Progress we'll be slower now that I got a full time job
- Reading [Shogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel)), [Human Heart, Cosmic Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30006169-human-heart-cosmic-heart), [West with the Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_with_the_Night) and [Voyage au Centre de la Terre](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_au_centre_de_la_Terre)
- Training Tai Chi
- Working out -- my daily training is based on calisthenics
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Playing with Rust and PostgreSQL
