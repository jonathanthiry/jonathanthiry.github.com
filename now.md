Days are getting longer here in Sweden and I try to catch the sun every day when I go out with my dog in the afternoon. I spend the rest of my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 1.3 - codename Details
- Reading [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers/download/), [Shop Class as Soulcraft](http://www.matthewbcrawford.com/new-page-1-1-2/), [A Place of My Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_My_Own), [Sauver le Monde](http://www.editionslesliensquiliberent.fr/livre-Sauver_le_monde-9791020901835-1-1-0-1.html), [The Baron in the Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baron_in_the_Trees), [Convict Conditioning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7305111-convict-conditioning), [Becoming the Iceman](http://becomingtheiceman.com/book), [Solitary Fitness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1906459.Solitary_Fitness) and other books in Swedish on bread making, food, drinks, nature and more that I buy second hand or borrow at the library
- Writing but I want to do it even more
- Improving my bread making skills
- Swimming once a week and working out at home the rest of the time
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside; I recently joined a club to meet the local community
