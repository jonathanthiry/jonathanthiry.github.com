title: What I'm doing now
---

- I am programming on the [Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science project](http://www.fieldsites.se/en-GB) and the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/) data portals since September 2017. We're helping researchers store and distribute data on the environment.
- Samantha and I bought a house in the Swedish countryside a year ago. Peaceful and spacious, I love the life.
- Reading The Handmaid's Tale and Unbroken.
- Working out -- my daily training is based on natural movement, both at home and at the gym.
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning.
- The last few months were beautiful and I enjoyed every moment spent in the garden. We didn't plant as much as I was hoping but we'll be better prepared next season.
- Helping people with their websites.
- Working on the next version of [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) -- 1.4 added a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview -- Progress has been extremely slow since I got a full time job and a house
