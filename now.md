I got a motorcycle and traveled to France in July. Now that I am back in Sweden I am looking for work opportunities and a permanent accomodation since we moved here recently. Then I spend my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 2 -- 1.4 was recently released to add a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview
- Reading [The Obelisk Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Obelisk_Gate) and [The Old Ways: A journey on Foot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13369533-the-old-ways) 
- Working out -- my daily training is based on calisthenics and convict conditionning 
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside
