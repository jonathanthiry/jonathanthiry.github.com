Days are getting longer here in Sweden and I try to catch the sun every day when I go out with my dog in the afternoon. I spend the rest of my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 1.3 - codename Details
- Reading [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers/download/), [Shop Class as Soulcraft](http://www.matthewbcrawford.com/new-page-1-1-2/), [A Place of My Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_My_Own), [Convict Conditioning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7305111-convict-conditioning), [Becoming the Iceman](http://becomingtheiceman.com/book), [Fifty Plants That Changed the Course of History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10155001-fifty-plants-that-changed-the-course-of-history) and [Cat's Cradle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle)
- Improving my bread making skills
- Swimming once a week and working out at home the rest of the time
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside; I recently joined a club to meet the local community
