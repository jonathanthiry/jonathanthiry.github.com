I'm relaxing by my parents in France until the beginning of January and I spend my time on:

- My family and friends
- Reading [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers/download/) and [The Good Gut](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Gut-Taking-Control-Long-term-ebook/dp/B00OZ0TOV2)
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning

In January, I'll go back to:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 1.3 - codename Details
- Swimming twice per week and working out at home the rest of the time
- Exploring ideas for future projects/work
