title: What I'm doing now
---

- With the spread of COVID-19, I have been working full time from home since mid-March. It has been a nice change of pace and allowed me to focus deep on some work tasks and to enjoy the beginning of spring at home.
- I am programming on the [Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science project](http://www.fieldsites.se/en-GB) and the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/) data portals since September 2017. We're helping researchers store and distribute data on the environment.
- Working out -- my daily training is based on natural movement and yoga. Not going to the gym pushes me to rethink how I can train at home, it's especially chalenging to train my legs without weight. For the upper-body, I have been exploring different styles of push-ups.
- Trail running -- I was preparing to run a 20km but it got cancelled, or at least delayed until later in the year. I'm still preparing to run a 30km in June even if it might be cancelled as well.
- Meditating -- I haven't been meditating much lately but I'm keeping it here to get back into it.
- Helping people with their websites.
- Working on the next version of [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) -- 1.4 added a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview -- Progress has been extremely slow since I got a full time job and a house
