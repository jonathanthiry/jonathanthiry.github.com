Days are getting longer here in Sweden and I try to catch the sun every day when I go out with my dog in the afternoon. I spend the rest of my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 1.4 
- Reading [Shop Class as Soulcraft](http://www.matthewbcrawford.com/new-page-1-1-2/), [A Place of My Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_My_Own), [Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein) 
- Swimming once a week and bodyweight training 5/6 days per week
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside; I recently joined a club to meet the local community
