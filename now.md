Samantha started a new job in the south of Sweden so we moved out of our apartement in Katrineholm and we're looking for a new permanent accomodation. I got a motorcycle and traveled to France a couple of weeks ago. Then I spend my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 2 -- 1.4 was recently released to add a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview
- Reading [Shop Class as Soulcraft](http://www.matthewbcrawford.com/new-page-1-1-2/), [A Place of My Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_My_Own), and [The Fifth Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Season_(novel))
- Working out -- my daily training is based on calisthenics and convict conditionning, I plan to swim in open water during the summer 
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside
