I'm back in Sweden after a couple of weeks in France and I spend my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 1.3 - codename Details
- Reading [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers/download/), [The Jungle Book](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35997) and [Shop Class as Soulcraft](http://www.matthewbcrawford.com/new-page-1-1-2/)
- Swimming twice per week and working out at home the rest of the time
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
