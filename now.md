After traveling to France and Poland, I am back in Sweden and I spend my time on:

- New features for [Wonder](/wonder)
- Reading [Fish on Friday](https://www.amazon.com/Fish-Friday-Feasting-Fasting-Discovery/dp/B000MR8TH2?tag=jonathanthiry-20) and [The Art of Travel](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Travel-Alain-Botton/dp/0375725342?tag=jonathanthiry-20)
- Working out at home
- Meditating 10 minutes in the morning
