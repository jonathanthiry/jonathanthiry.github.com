I started to work at Lund's University on the [Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science project](http://www.fieldsites.se/en-GB) and the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/).
At the same time, Samantha and I are looking for a permanent accomodation around Lund. I spend the rest of my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 2 -- 1.4 was recently released to add a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview -- Progress we'll be slower now that I got a full time job
- Reading [Shogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel)) and [Travels with Charley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travels_with_Charley)
- Training Aikido since the beginning of September
- Working out -- my daily training is based on calisthenics and convict conditionning 
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside
