I started to work at Lund's University on the [Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science project](http://www.fieldsites.se/en-GB), an offspring of the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/).
We're looking to get a house in the region, we've seen a few but it might take some time to find the right one. Then I spend my time on:

- Working on [Wonder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-reader-for-wikipedia/id1050888989?mt=8&at=1010lo2M) 2 -- 1.4 was recently released to add a swiping gesture to close tabs, restoration of the scrolling position on launch, and custom peek and pop preview -- Progress we'll be slower now that I got a full time job
- Reading [Shogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel)), [The Book of Five Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Five_Rings), [Eating Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_Animals) and [The Old Ways: A journey on Foot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13369533-the-old-ways) 
- Working out -- my daily training is based on calisthenics and convict conditionning 
- Meditating a few minutes every day, preferably in the morning
- Photographing friends, family and all kind of things when I go outside
