A small village in Spain and its charismatic leader created an alternative community. In contrast to the rest of the country, people have homes, food, work and overall a better life. It's a concrete alternative to the struggling capitalist society. The author presents the origins and the limits of this interesting take on the search for a better lifestyle.
